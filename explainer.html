                                <p class="lead">The Invasion of Poland in 1939 for many marks the start of World War II in Europe and provides a unique opportunity to examine the destruction of a state. The rise of the Nazis in Germany brought the ideology of Lebensraum, the expansion of territorial control for ethnic German, into the realm of policy. </p>

                                <p class="lead">Germany isolated Poland from its neighbors and the acceptance of Polish nationalism within a multicultural Polish state with a large German minority, finally culminating in a military invasion when the Polish government did not capitulate to increasing German demands. Germany also employed the Soviet Union, Poland’s historic enemy, to assist in the demolishment of the state from all directions. The invasion of Poland is a study in what makes a state and how to pull those pieces apart.</p>

                                <p class="lead">On September 1, 1939, Germany launched an operation that would lead to the occupation of Poland and the start of World War II.  On the morning of the 1st at 4:40am, the German Luftwaffe began bombing the Polish border town of Wieluń in Southwest Poland. At 4:48am the German battleship, Schleswig-Holstein, began shelling the Polish garrison on the Westerplatte, outside the northern Free City of Danzig.</p>

                                <p class="lead">To the East was the Soviet Union, a country Poland had fought just 17 years earlier for control of its eastern territories. To the North, West, and South lay Nazi Germany after its successful seizure of the Sudetenland and a large portion of Czechoslovakia (the Eastern portion then Slovakia simply allied with the Nazis). Despite its 1934 Non-Aggression Pact with Germany, Poland was infiltrated with German propaganda publicly decrying the treatment of ethnic Germans. </p>
                                <p class="lead">The Free City of Danzig, Poland’s sole gateway to the seas, became a target of German demands due, in part, to its large German population.  In this atmosphere, Poland struggled to balance the interests of its neighbors, increasingly isolating itself from both Germany and the Soviet Union. </p>

                                <p class="lead">In August of 1939, Poland’s refusal to allow Russian troops into Polish territory derailed an anti-German Pact between France, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. Seizing the opportunity, Germany negotiated the Molotov-Ribbentrop Non-Aggression Pact with Russia. A secret part of the agreement coordinated German and Soviet plans to favorably redraw the borders of Eastern Europe and annex many of the weaker states of the region, including Poland.</p>

                                <p class="lead">Following the signing of the pact on August 23, Germany was prepared to launch an invasion of Poland on August 26.  The day before the invasion, however, Poland and the United Kingdom publicly signed the Polish-British Common Defence Pact, declaring British military support for the territorial integrity of Poland. Germany in response delayed its surprise attack until September 1. </p>

                                <p class="lead">Starting on September 1, German forces moved swiftly through the country towards the Polish capital, Warsaw. While the Polish military fought valiantly, it was overwhelmed, under-mobilized and incapable of halting the German invasions from the North, West, and South. The first German troops would reach the outskirts of Warsaw on September 8, just 8 days into the invasion. As the German forces neared, the Polish General Staff fled northeast towards Bialystock, while the civilian government moved east towards Romania.</p>

The attack plan, rejected by the Polish General Staff, would initially be a success, but ultimately result in the destruction of both Army groups, the surrender of over 170,000 Polish troops, and another 50,000 casualties by the end of the battle on September 19.</p>

Poland was now besieged from all sides and the hopes of a desperate mass mobilization near Lublin to regroup and launch a counterattack against the Germans was destroyed.</p>

On September 27, Warsaw fell, but Polish troops in the city successfully hid military equipment for later use by the Polish Underground, a Polish resistance movement. Other parts of the Polish military would continue to fight in the Southeast protecting the civilian government’s retreat towards Romania. On September 30, Ignacy Mościcki, the Polish President, resigned, handing power to Polish officials in Paris. Fighting ended on October 6 as the last active Polish military unit was defeated in the Battle of Kock near Lublin.
