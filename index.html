  <h1 class="page-heading">Poland: State Under Siege</h1>
        <!-- <span class="post-meta">May 25, 2015</span> -->
           <p>September 1, 1939: Barely two decades old, Poland found itself surrounded by the two expansionist great powers of Europe - Germany and the Soviet Union. At the outbreak of war, Poland’s expansionist neighbors invaded from all sides, pushing for Warsaw and overrunning the outnumbered and outmoded Polish army. With France and Great Britain reluctant to fight another costly war against Germany, over the long weeks of September Poland collapsed militarily, politically, economically, and socially. Hitler and Stalin committed their empires to not only the defeat of the Polish military and the partition of Polish territory, but also the elimination of Poland’s national identity. Join us as we travel through history to examine Poland’s desperate prewar diplomatic maneuvers, its defense against the onslaught of the Wehrmacht and the Red Army, and its struggle to survive occupation.</p>

    <h1 class="page-heading">An Introduction to Staff Rides</h1>

        <!-- <span class="post-meta">May 25, 2015</span> -->
        <p>How did Germany and the Soviet Union break Poland militarily and politically in less than a month? Could Poland have survived this onslaught? What was it like to be a civilian in a collapsing state? A Staff Ride tackles questions like these by asking students to inhabit and present the viewpoints of significant figures in history’s most important military campaigns. By presenting a diverse perspective of events, we will develop nuanced views of the strategy, leadership, and decision-making that changed motivated history and which continue to inform today’s engagements. <br>    <br><img src="gdansk.png"><br><br><br>In March of 2016, students and faculty from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) will travel to Germany and Poland to study the leadup, conduct, and aftermath of Germany and the USSR’s 1939 invasion of Poland. Starting with the 1938 Munich Agreement, we will trace the immense political and military pressures that Germany and the Soviet Union placed on Poland and its western allies. We will explore a troubling history of diplomatic concessions, military failures, and ethnic conflict as Poland fights for its existence. Join us as we see first hand how a total war starts--and experience the chilling reminders of its terrible cost. .</p>
